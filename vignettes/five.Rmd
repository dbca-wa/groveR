## Purpose
Clouds are the bane of remote sensing studies. They obscure the reflectance values 
of the end members we are interested in and if not dealt with will skew results. 
When mosaicking multiple satellite scenes together, inevitably there will be the 
odd year when including some cloud or haze is unavoidable.

`groveR` has a two step process for dealing with clouds:

* Digitised clouds are converted to masks with the appropriate extents and pixel 
size for your data using `make_mask()`.
* Clouds are then accounted for in the correct annual mosaic using `cloud_mask()` 
which encodes the spatial location so that they can either be omitted from the 
analysis entirely or form part of a fuzzy classification where a probable 
classification based on the prior year's data is constructed.

## Use the make_mask() function
The user first familiarises themselves with the original mosaics, identifies cloud 
or smoke haze, digitises a polygon around them and saves the result as a shape file. 
The shape file must have an attribute column called "year" which is populated with 
the 4 digit year that the cloud was observed in. One shape file can contain the 
digitised boundaries of all clouds identified through the entire time series of 
mosaics. The test data includes an example located at `vectors/cloud_vectors.shp`.
```{r, make_mask, eval=FALSE}
# The general form of the function is (NOTE the default parameters)
make_mask(ivect, refimage, attribname = "year", loc ="raster_masks/cloud_masks")

# We only need to assign the first 2 parameters as the defaults are fine
ivect <- "vectors/cloud_vectors.shp"
refimage <- "veg_dens/Test_Park_vdens_2011.tif"

# Run the function
make_mask(ivect, refimage)

```

* **ivect** - input file path to cloud shape file.
* **refimage** - file path to any raster that has been created during processing 
thus far. The format of the raster is used as a template to create the cloud masks.

## What's going to happen?
One cloud mask for each unique year found in the attribute column of the cloud 
shape file will be written to `raster_masks/cloud_masks/`.

## Use the cloud_mask() function
Next we apply the cloud masks we just made to the appropriate vegetation density 
annual rasters.
```{r, cloud_mask, eval=FALSE}
# The general form of the function is (NOTE the default parameters)
cloud_mask(irast, imask, ext = ".tif")

# We only need to assign the first 2 parameters as the defaults are fine
irast <- "veg_dens_mskd"
imask <- "raster_masks/cloud_masks"

# Run the function
cloud_mask(irast, imask)

```

* **irast** - input masked veg density rasters directory.
* **imask** - input cloud masks raster directory.

## What's going to happen now?
Any annual previously masked veg density rasters that had cloud will be encoded 
with a -99 where clouds were and written to the `veg_dens_mskd_cld/`. All non-cloudy 
previously masked veg density rasters will be copied over to the same directory 
and renamed.
