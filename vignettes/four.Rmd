## Purpose
Masking is important in remote sensing analysis as it is used to exclude 
areas not intended for processing and thereby analysis. This focuses the analysis  
and cuts down processing times as only what's important is worked on.

General masking is where areas common to all image time steps are masked. For example in 
this study, land above the high water level where mangroves don't grow, is 
excluded. Masking that affects only specific time steps, for example cloud or haze, is 
covered in the next vignette.

## Use the general_mask() function
To mask out an area, a raster mask is applied to a raster of interest. Usually a 
mask is generated with 1's and 0 values (or NA's), where 1's indicate the area of 
interest. When the mask is applied, any areas where there is a 0 is excluded.

The example data includes a land mask and is the only mask residing in the 
`raster_masks/` directory and this will be applied below. 
```{r, gen_msk, eval=FALSE}
# The general form of the function is (NOTE the default parameters)
general_mask <- function(irast, imask, ext = ".tif", mval = 0)

# the mval parameter is the "mask value" i.e. what value to mask out.

# We only need to assign the first 2 parameters as the defaults are fine
irast <- "veg_dens"
imask <- "raster_masks"

# Run the function
general_mask(irast, imask)
```

* **irast** - input veg density rasters directory.
* **imask** - input masks raster directory.

## What's going to happen?
A new directory will be created, `veg_dens_mskd/` and the masked 
vegetation density rasters will be written to it. These will be the inputs for 
other functions.

**NOTE on general masks**. The above example is only applying one land mask, 
however if there were multiple masks then they would also be applied. This is so 
you can have different masks relating to different entities, such as one for land, 
one for reefs etc. When the `general_mask()` function looks for input masks it does 
not recursively examine the `imask` directory which is why cloud masks can reside 
in a directory at that location too.
